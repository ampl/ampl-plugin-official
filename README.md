# AMPL Language support

![AMPL Logo](resources/logo.png)

The AMPL VS Code Extension provides language support for AMPL, including syntax highlighting and integration with the AMPL runtime.

## Features

### 1. Syntax Highlighting
Enjoy full syntax highlighting for `.mod`, `.run`, and `.dat` files. Highlighting for `.dat`files is basic, to support big file sizes.

valid constructs are flagged as errors, please disable diagnostic with:
